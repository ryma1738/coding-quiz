# Coding Quiz Challage!

## Description
This is a short 5 question quiz that I created as part of a challange for my class. built from the ground up by me. This quiz gives players a high score at the end. On the high scores page it will display the top 5 high scores. Scores are calculated by number of questions right (100 point bonus if you get them all right) and subtracting the amount of time it took to complete the quiz.
